## How To Use
Visit https://budgetvaultapp.herokuapp.com/ to use the app. Click the 'Compose A Budget' button to create a budget. Enter your budget name, choose a currency, and enter an amount. Add an expense and it will subtract from your balance and display on the screen. Feel like your budget is getting a little low? You can modify your budget by clicking on the icon next to the budget amount. Once you've reached a good stopping point, click on the check icon to save and exit. You can edit or view your budget at anytime. Click on the corresponding table, or the view icon on mobile devices, to open the edit modal. Compose an other budget!
